**NOTE, 1 October 2020 the label 'master' was replaced by 'main' for the default repo branch.**

## Introduction

This post shows how you can use the git command line tool for cloning Karttur's GeoImagine Framework to your local machine. The instructions are intended for developers that want to contribute towards the project. The instructions cover the required steps for forking and cloning of remotes for both _origin_ and _upstream_, and the creation of a development branch. The latter is then pushed to the online GitHub repo _origin_ owned by the developer. The post ends with a command line script that will automate all the processing except forking.

## Prerequisits

You have to have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, preferably set up to allow access using SSH, as outlined in the post on [Remote repositories with GitHub](../git-github).

## Sign up with GitHub.com

To contribute towards Karttur's GeoImagine Framework you have to sign up with [GitHub.com](https://github.com) - see the post on [Remote repositories with GitHub](../git-github).

## For developers

Participating in external project development via GitHub is usually done by forking the project repo(s) and then clone the forked repo(s) to a local machine where the development takes place. Often the original GitHub project is linked as an additional _remote_ repo (usually given the alias _upstream_). Individual developers then create their own branches where the developments will be _commited_. Suggested changes or edits can then be sent back as pull requests to the maintainers of the original (_upstream_) site.

The same steps are also followed in these instructions. But I also supply a command line script that automate all required local git processing for setting up the development system. Applying the script, as a developer you only need to fork the repos from [github.com/karttur](https://github.com/karttur) to your account, the script will do the rest.

### Repos belonging to KartturÂ´s GeoImagine Framework

Karttur's GeoImagine Framework includes approximately 40 repos. All repos contain Python packages and are named after the package with the prefix "geoimagine-" added. The package _dem_ is for example available in the repo _geoimagine-dem_, the package _region_ in the repo _geoimagine-region_. Complete list of packages, all available as GitHub repositories:

- ancillary
- dem
- endmembers
- export
- extract
- gdalutilities
- gis
- grace
- image
- jekyllise
- kartturmain
- ktgraphics
- ktnumba
- ktpandas
- landsat
- layout
- mask
- modis
- ortho
- overlay
- postgresdb
- projects
- region
- scalar
- sentinel
- setup_db
- setup_processes
- smap
- soilmoisture
- specials
- sqldump
- support
- timeseries
- transfer
- transform
- updatedb
- userproj
- zipper

If you want to work with the complete Framework, you must fork all repos available at [karttur's repos](https://github.com/karttur) that have the prefix _geoimagine-_.

### Fork source repo

### Clone to local machine

As mentioned above, you can follow the step-by-step manual for cloning to the Framework to your local machine. Of you can just skip to the command line (bash) script and use it for setting up the entire Framework as git repos including remotes for both _origin_ and _upstream_. The script requires that you have a SSH key for the GitHub account that received the forks of the original repos.

#### Clone using terminal I

Open a <span class='app'>terminal</span> window and change directory (<span class='terminalapp'>cd</span>) to the parent folder where you want to have the clone of GeoImagine package. You need to consider how you have/want to setup the PyDev Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to be used for running the Framework. That is, do you want to clone the Framework to the working directory of your IDE (for instance <span class='app'>Eclipse</span>) or do you want to use git terminal command for version control outside of the IDE? This post is for using git terminal commands for handling versions. How to operate git from inside <span class='app'>Eclipse</span> is covered in the post [Setup Eclipse teamed with GitHub repository](https://karttur.github.io/geoimagine/develop/develop-github-eclipse/).

<span class='terminal'>$ cd /path/to/framework/parent/</span>

While the online repo has the prefix "_geoimagine-_" you should remove that for the local clone. That is simply done using the standard clone command <span class='terminalapp'>git clone [source-url] [target-name]</span>.

<span class='terminal'>$ git clone git@github.com:"YourGitHubAccount"/geoimagine-setup_db.git setup_db </span>

```
Cloning into 'setup_db'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 10, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (9/9), done.
remote: Total 124 (delta 2), reused 4 (delta 0), pack-reused 114
Receiving objects: 100% (124/124), 65.10 KiB | 653.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (66/66), done.
```

<span class='terminalapp'>cd</span> to the _cloned_ package/repo/directory and list (ls) the content:

<span class='terminal'>$ cd setup_db<br>$ ls</span>

```
README.md		doc			setup_db_main.py
__init__.py		setup_db_class.py	version.py
```

#### Clone using terminal II

An alternative method for cloning a repository to your local machine is to first create the directory, initiate git for the directory, link (add) to a remote repository and then pull the content from the remote repo to the local clone. The commands for the equivalent cloning done in the previous section then becomes:

<span class='terminal'>$ mkdir setup_db<br>
$ cd setup_db<br>
$ git init<br>
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:karttur/geoimagine-setup_db.git<br>
$ git pull origin master<br>
</span>

#### Create development branch

As a developer wanting to contribute, I suggest that you create a branch called "dev" and then use that for _staging_ and _committing_ development work. If you run the script below for setting up your local clone of the Framework, it includes the creation of the branch dev.

Working with branches is explored in detail in the post [git branches in local repositories](../git-branches), expanded for use with GitHub in [Remote repositories with GitHub](../git-github) and also how to use with forks in [Forking repositories](../git-forks).

With the <span class='app'>Terminal</span> window still in your local repository, type:

<span class='terminal'>$ git branch</span>

```
* master
```

There is only one branch in your repo, _master_.

Create a new branch and immediately switch to this branch:
<span class='terminal'>$ git checkout -b dev</span>

 ```
Switched to a new branch 'dev'
```

#### dev-readme.md

The command line script included below creates a readme file for each repo that it clones, <span class='file'>dev-readme.md</span>. The script then writes some basic information on the user (GitHub account name, the date of creating and the name of the PyDev package/repo) to the file. As the file constitute a change, it also supports the initial _stage_ and _commit_ for starting the development branch. Tho create the file manually:

<span class='terminal'>$ pico dev-readme.md</span>

```
# Development of Karttur's GeoImagine Framework by "YourGitHubAccount", initiated YYYY-MM-DD

## package: "package"
```

Hit [ctrl]+[X] to exit <span class='terminalapp'>pico</span> and save the edits by pressing <span class='terminal'>Y</span> when asked.

#### Stage and commit changes

With edits done to the readme files you can _stage_ (add) and _commit_ (lock in and save) the changes to your local git repository:

<span class='terminal'>git add .<br>
git commit \-m \'initiated dev\'</span>

If all the files that you want to commit have already been staged before, you can shorten the two commands:

<span class='terminal'>git commit \-am \'initiated dev\'</span>

You can check out if anything is pending in the active branch (_dev_):

<span class='terminal'>$ git status</span>

```
On branch dev
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

To get a graphical view of the _commit_ log:

<span class='terminal'>$ git log \-\-all \-\-decorate \-\-oneline \-\-graph</span>

```
* a4efe67 (HEAD -> dev) initiated dev
*   217a091 (origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) Merge pull request #1 from "YourGitHubAccount"/setup_db_main-edits
```

From the returned message you can see that the local _HEAD_ pointer is ahead of _origin/master_, _origin/HEAD_, _master_, where _origin_ is the default alias for the primary remote repository.

#### Push

Confirm the remote connections of the cloned repo you are working with:

<span class='terminal'>$ git remote -v</span>

```
origin	git@github.com:"YourGitHubAccount"/geoimagine-setup_db.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:"YourGitHubAccount"/geoimagine-setup_db.git (push)
```

To send your local changes to your GitHub online account including the new branch _dev_:

<span class='terminal'>$ git push -u origin dev</span>

```

 * [new branch]      dev -> dev
Branch 'dev' set up to track remote branch 'dev' from 'origin'.
```

If you execute the extended <span class='terminalapp'>log</span>, you will see that the branch _origin/dev_ has been added, and is up to date with the local _dev_ branch.

<span class='terminal'>$ git log \-\-all \-\-decorate \-\-oneline \-\-graph</span>

*   217a091 (origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) Merge pull request #1 from "YourGitHubAccount",/setup_db_main-edits
```

Return to your browser and your online GitHub account with the fork of "geoimagine-setup_db". There should now be one additional branch. If you click on the button <span class='button'>Branch: master</span> a dropdown menu shows all the branches (and some actions you can take).

#### Clone _upstream_

As a developer you probably want to keep up to date with changes in the  _master_ branch of the original repository (at [github.com/karttur](https://github.com/karttur) in this case). The git convention is to add the original _master_ as an additional remote with the alias _upstream_. You are not able to _push_ any changes to this repo, but you can _fetch_ and _merge_ any updates by including it as a remote. Later that will facilitate the development work, including _rebasing_ to keep your changes in coherence with other developments and for pull request - all explained in the [next](../git-karttur-geoimagine-pull-request) post).

To clone Karttur's original repo to your local repo as a remote with the alias _upstream_:

<span class="terminal">$
git remote add upstream git@github.com:karttur/geoimagine-setup_db.git</span>

### Command line script

The command line script clones both the forked (_origin_) and Karttur's original (_upstream_) repository, create a development branch (_dev_) and _push_ that to _origin_. To run the script you must:

- set "YourGitHubAccount"
- set "YourEmail@server.xx"
- Have a SSH key for this account and email
- select which repos to clone (default = all)
- open a <span class='app'>Terminal</span> window
- change directory (<span class='terminalapp'>cd</span>) to the parent folder for the selected repos
- copy and paste the edited code at the terminal prompt and execute

```
# You have to give your correct GitHub user account and email for the script to push
readonly GitHubUser="YourGitHubAccount"
readonly email=YourEmail@server.xx

   # link kartturs master branch as upstream
   git remote add upstream "git@github.com:karttur/geoimagine-""$repo"".git"

   # sync kartturs master branch
   git pull upstream master

   # Create a dev-readme.md file with some basic notes
   echo "# Development of Karttur's GeoImagine Framework by ""$GitHubUser"", initiated ""$thisday" > dev-readme.md
   echo "" >> dev-readme.md
   echo "## package: ""$repo" >> dev-readme.md

   # Create a new branch, dev
   git checkout -b dev

   # stage the changes to the dev branch
   git add .

   # commit changes to the dev branch
   git commit -m "initiated dev"

   # push the changes to GitHub including a new branch   
   git push -u origin dev

   # change directory to parent folder
   cd ..
done
```
