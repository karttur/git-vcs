**NOTE, 1 October 2020 the label 'main' was replaced by 'main' for the default repo branch.**

## Introduction

This post is a manual on how to create and manage this blog ([git command line](https://karttur.github.io/git-vcs/)) using the local git command line tool.

## Prerequisits

You have to have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, preferably set up to allow access using SSH, as outlined in the post on [Remote repositories with GitHub](../git-github). The content and layout of this blog is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static web-site generator. To follow this post you do not need to use Jekyll, but the trick is that [GitHub](https://github.com) is set up for handling Jekyll and create static web-pages (blogs for example) from Jekyll. And it is all for free. To learn about Jekyll, and how I created my blogs and pages, please see [Set up blog tools: Jekyll and Atom](https://karttur.github.io/setup-blog/) and [Setup Jekyll Theme Blog](https://karttur.github.io/setup-theme-blog/).

## Creating a new GitHub repo

You can only create an online GitHub repo using a browser while being logged in to your GitHub account. Explained in the GitHub page on [Creating a new repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). However, you only need to create the repo, everything else can be done from your local command line as outlined on another of GitHubÂ´s help pages [Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line](https://help.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

### Creating a new gh-pages blog repo

As an example of setting up and managing a repo after only creating it online, this post will take you through how to create a repo for _gh-pages_ - that is the GitHub system for free publishing of web-pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

A GitHub repo for publishing must replace the default branch _main_  with a branch named _gh-pages_. Thus, the setup of _gh-pages_ using the local command line tool is a bit more complicated compared to setting up an ordinary repo with branches.

First you have to go to your online [GitHub](https://github.com) account and create a new repo. Just the repo name, nothing else, then click the <span class='button'>Create repository</span> button, as shown below.

When the new repo is created, GitHub will show a page with hints on how to proceed with "Quick setup..." and other options.

### Create local repo

Open a <span class='app'>Terminal</span> window and change directory <span class='terminalapp'>cd</span> to the parent folder where you want to keep the local clone.

#### Alternative I

![github-settings-menu-SSH-keys](../../images/github-code-alts.png){: .pull-right}
When the new repo is created, click on the green button <span class='button'>Code</span>. There are (in November 2020) 4 alternatives for cloning, plus the additional options [Open with GitHub Desktop] and [Download ZIP]. Copy the text for the clone alternative [SSH], as shown in the figure to the right. Return to the local terminal command line, and make sure you are in the parent directory where you want to place the local clone. Then type (but do **not** execute):

<span class='terminal'>$ git clone </span>

If you followed the instructions in the previous section, you can now just paste the SSH link from your clipboard to the command line:

<span class='terminal'>$ git clone git@github.com:karttur/"repo".git</span

Change directory (<span class='terminalapp'>cd</span>) to the cloned repo:

<span class='terminal'>$ cd "repo"</span




#### Alternative II

Create a new directory, the easiest is to name it identical with your newly created online repo:

<span class='terminal'>$ mkdir git-vcs</span>

<span class='terminalapp'>cd</span> to the new directory and initiate git:

<span class='terminal'>$ cd git-vcs<br>$ git init</span>

You can also initiate the local repo from the parent:

<span class='terminal'>$ git init git-vcs<br>$ cd git-vcs</span>

### Configure repo

To get the new repo started, configure the local repo user and email if they differ from your global user and email:

<span class='terminal'>$ git config user.name _repo-username_</span>

<span class='terminal'>$ git config \-\- user.email _email@example.com_</span>

Check the branch of your local repo:

<span class='terminal'>$ git branch</span>

If should say * main. if there is no branch you need to create an initial branch. You can choose to create either _main_ or _gh-pages_ (or a branch with any other name), but as you might end up with a _main_ branch let us first create _main_ and then replace it with _gh-pages_.

<span class='terminal'>$ git checkout -b main</span>

```
Switched to a new branch 'main'
```

If you check the branch of your local repo:

<span class='terminal'>$ git branch</span>

```
\* main
```

If no branch is reported, this is because you have not yet _staged_ and _committed_ any content.  You can then safely continue, just ignore that the branch name is not seen.

As noted above, for GitHub to be used for publishing web-pages, you need to replace _main_ with _gh-pages_, **not** create _gh-pages_ as a new branch from _main_. _gh-pages_  is thus an _orphan_ branch that takes the place of _main_. This is accomplished with the command:

<span class='terminal'>$ git checkout \-\-orphan gh-pages</span>

```
Switched to a new branch 'gh-pages'
```

Commit the changes

<span class='terminal'>git commit -m "created gh-pages"</span>

```
[gh-pages (root-commit) 8934df7] created gh-pages
 2 files changed, 676 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 LICENSE
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

If you rerun the command:

<span class='terminal'>$ git branch</span>

```
\* gh-pages
  main
```

### Create some content

At this stage you need to create some content, either a complete jekyll page, or you can start with a README.md:

<span class='terminal'>$ pico README.md</span>

```
# blog on command line based git processing
```

Hit [ctrl]+[X] to exit <span class='terminalapp'>pico</span> and save the edits by pressing <span class='terminal'>Y</span> when asked.

### _stage_ and _commit_

_stage_ and _commit_ the changes you have made, they will belong the branch _gh-pages_:

<span class='terminal'>$ git add .<br>$ git commit \-m \'Created README.md\'</span>

```
[gh-pages (root-commit) aa6a314] Created README.md
 X files changed, Y insertions(+)
 create mode ...
 ...
```

Again try the command:

<span class='terminal'>$ git branch</span>

```
\* gh-pages
```

This time, gh-pages should be your only branch. If not, you need to delete other branches.

<span class='terminal'>$ git branch -d [branch]</span>

or to force delete if the branch contains un-megred changes:

<span class='terminal'>$ git branch -D [branch]</span>

### add remote

Your local account is not linked to any of your online GitHub repos. To link it, execute the command:

<span class='terminal'>$ git remote add origin git@github.com:"yourGitHubAccount"/git-vcs.git</span>

Before _pushing_ to our, completely empty, online GitHub repo, _stage_ and _commit_ any changes.

### git push

The local repo now contains a single branch, _gh-pages_, with some novel content that is _staged_ and _commited_. _push_ the content of the repo to your online account:

<span class='terminal'>$ git push origin gh-pages</span>

```

As you see from the last line, you online GitHub repository got a new branch, _gh-pages_.

#### _stage_ and _commit_ changes

I created a complete suite of Jekyll pages, the blog you are looking at now. But I forgot to update my Jekyll configuration file, <span class='file'>\_config.yml</span>. I also added a figure and then this post is itself progressing for every new part I write. After completing these edits, I ran the following sequence of commands:

<span class='terminal'>$ git add .<br>$ git commit \-am \"initial updates\"<br>$ git push origin gh-pages</span>

```

It turned out that my documents had several spelling mistakes, and I also changed the names of all the posts. There are also some further posts I need to write. If you look at the online repo for this blog, you will thus see further _commits_.
